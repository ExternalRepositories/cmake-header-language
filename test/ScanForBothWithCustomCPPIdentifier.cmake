# /test/ScanForBothWithCustomCPPIdentifier.cmake
# Adds some source files which will be detected as C source files
# and include a header in them, with ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/include
# to be used as the include-directory.
#
# Add POLYSQUARE_BEGIN_DECLS to the header file and let
# cppcheck_target_sources know about that identifier. This shall make it scanned
# in both modes
