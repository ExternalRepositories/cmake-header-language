# Add source and header files in the following include hierarchy:
# Toplevel.h
# |
# -Immediate.h
#  |
#  - CSource.c
#  - CXXSource.cxx
# - CXXSource.cxx
#
# Immediate.h is included by at least one C source, so it becomes a "C"
# header. Because Immediate.h includes Toplevel.h, it also becomes a "C"
# header too, even though CXXSource.cxx includes it.
